# EDA-101: Exploratory Data Analysis Project

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
This is my first project in a series where I practice **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** â€” the process of looking at a dataset, asking questions, and using visualizations to find insights.  

Think of this repo as a small case study that shows how I approach data: from raw files, to cleaned versions, to notebooks full of charts, and finally to clear takeaways.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Layout
Hereâ€™s how the project is organized (so it feels like a real data science workflow):

- **data/raw/** â†’ the original dataset (always kept untouched)  
- **data/processed/** â†’ cleaned or transformed data, ready for analysis  
- **notebooks/** â†’ Jupyter notebooks where the analysis and visualizations live  
- **reports/figures/** â†’ saved charts and plots for quick viewing  
- **src/** â†’ helper Python code (functions, scripts, etc.)  
- **tests/** â†’ small tests to make sure the code runs correctly

## ðŸ“Š Sample Result

Hereâ€™s one example from the analysis â€” survival by gender:
